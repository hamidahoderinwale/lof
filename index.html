    <section>
      <p><strong>lohf</strong> (pronounced <em>lōf</em>) is a research project built around the goal of capturing and working with procedural knowledge. This is my (stand-in) site to share the work that comes from this project. This rendition and a future one is a home for the artifacts of my research—projects, papers, essays, and the occasional experiment. It's also a space to reflect on how these pieces came to be.</p>

      <h2>The future of this site</h2>
      <p>This site is a little experiment in itself—to capture the process as well as the product. An attempt to preserve not only what I work on, but how I work—and to invite others to do the same. What should the modern library contain? What structures does it need? And how might we better understand, document, and share the context that underlies our collective knowledge?</p>

      <p>More concretely:</p>
        - I hope to have a working version of the loaf platform which will allow me to version control the work that I do to my liking.</li>
