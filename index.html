    <p>lohf (pronounced lōf) is a research project built around the goal of capturing and working with procedural knowledge. This is my (stand-in) site to share the work that comes from this project. This rendition and a future one is a home for the artifacts of my research—projects, papers, essays, and the occasional experiment. It's also a space to reflect on how these pieces came to be.</p>

    <h2>How did lohf come to be?</h2>
    <p>My work is driven by a curiosity about how we organize, preserve, and build upon knowledge. Libraries offer a helpful metaphor: they're not just collections of information, but also systems—designed ways of making that information useful, navigable, and meaningful. What happens when we rethink the idea of a library? How might we redesign it to reflect the kinds of knowledge worth preserving today—not just outputs, but also the context behind them?</p>
    
    <p>Context is fundamental to understanding. It includes not just what was created, but how it came about—the thinking, decisions, tools, and people behind the work. Capturing that context is hard. It's messy, time-consuming, and difficult to represent cleanly. Yet it's also essential. Documentation is one way we try—"codified context" that bridges tacit knowledge and explicit instruction. But it often misses the deeper layers: process, intention, and the invisible scaffolding behind the final result.</p>

    <h2>The future of this site</h2>
    <p>This site is a little experiment in itself—to capture the process as well as the product. An attempt to preserve not only what I work on, but how I work—and to invite others to do the same. What should the modern library contain? What structures does it need? And how might we better understand, document, and share the context that underlies our collective knowledge?</p>
    
    <p>More concretely:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I hope to have a working version of the loaf platform which will allow me to version control the work that I do to my liking.</li>
    </ul>
