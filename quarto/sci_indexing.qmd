# New Gen Research Indexing 
Elevator pitch: Our research corpora is the collection of human insight. Certain aspects were thoughtfully constructed (i.e. citations and indexing algorithms), others were products of circumstance, and some are relics of the past. What does the ideal scientific literature, corpora, and search engine interface look like (in the generative age)? With the main goal being that researchers should be able to find the work that is the most valuable to them. An auxiliary goal being that automated reasoning systems (ML systems) can best take advantage of the literature to speed up the discovery process. The (key) audience in mind is the Google Scholar team; a secondary audience would be the Elicit AI team.

Core Q: How is the discovery, evaluation, and use of research changing in the generative era? How can we redesign research indexing to meet these new challenges and opportunities?

Novel contributions: In the rigorous, quantitative estimate of an implemented framework, detailed sketch of what an implementation would look like, the review of the literature because it’s been unexplored. Solid, concrete directions for work (practical, useful details and caveats).

- We could enter a new age of search indexing (where it’s dynamic, concept-based, and decentralized): imagine that you had influence scores for training data inputs. 
- Synthetic or low-value research is much easier to produce now and indexers should work on promoting high-value, novel content to those who are using a search engine. 
- Tagging papers by type (survey, experimental, empirical, etc.). 
- Privacy-preserving activity logging and knowing where sources are found from. 
- Memorized completions aren’t as useful here. 
- Centralized platforms own critical metadata (e.g. citation graphs) that make decentralized or open alternatives difficult to access. 
- Keeping the chat history for certain projects centralized and then citing them. 
- A new age of search for research papers that relate to the concepts in the papers themselves: how do you unlock semantic search?
- Integrating OpenReview and peer review into the search process as a means of including confidence metrics into the works themselves. 
- Questions: What is Google Scholar’s dominance and over what time period?
- Having citations for Datasets (NeurIPS announced their Datasets and Benchmark track in 2022 and we should incentivize the development of datasets and part of that comes with attribution and ownership)

## Auxiliary
- Some issues like if you web scrapers that surpass paywalls then the scientists don’t get paid (but that never really mattered: could run an experiment and see if that’s possible -- jailbreaking)
